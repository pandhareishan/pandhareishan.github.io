Portfolio site scaffold for Ishan Pandhare — Electrical Engineer

How to publish (recommended):

1. Ensure your GitHub repo is named `pandhareishan.github.io` for user pages.
2. Initialize the repo (if not already), add files, commit, and push:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/working/folder
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/pandhareishan/github.io.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio scaffold"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. GitHub will publish at `https://pandhareishan.github.io` (if repo name matches). If your repo has a different name, enable Pages in the repository settings and select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.

Update the resume:
- Replace `resume.pdf` at the repository root with your PDF file.
- Update contact links in `index.html`.

Customization tips:
- Edit `index.html` for content and project links.
- Edit `css/styles.css` for colors and spacing.

If you want, I can:
- Add a `resume.pdf` upload placeholder now.
- Customize copy for each project with links.
- Commit and push these files to your remote for you (requires auth).
